> My fist app "real app" in react. An expenses track app integrated with firebase.  

### About the app

I develope the base of  this app in the module II in the Rockseat Ignite bootcamp (ğŸš€). As developing a expense track was kind of my dream, I decided to take it to the next level, implementing an authentication system and a database (thanks Firbase).

### Adjusts and fixes
I'm still working in this app, so a couple of tasks still peding:

- [ ] finishe the login system
- [ ] integrate with real time database
- [ ] desing a new logo and collor pallee
